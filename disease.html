                            <h3 class="mb-4">Introduction to fish diseases</h3>
                            <p>Fish diseases may cause severe losses on fish farms through, reduced fish growth and production, increased feeding cost caused by lack of appetite and waste of uneaten feed, increased vulnerability to predation, increased susceptibility to low water quality and death of fish. While it may be difficult to avoid fish diseases completely, it is better to try to prevent their occurrence rather than to allow them to develop and then attempting to cure them once they start to cause problems. To cure a fish disease is much more difficult and generally calls for the services of a specialist. By the time proper treatment can be organized, the disease may have become more serious. In some cases surviving fish are so weakened that effective treatment becomes difficult.<br><br>However several simple and effective treatments can be used, either for prevention or early control of disease before it becomes too serious. In all cases, you will have to handle chemicals and know about their dangers and their use.</p>

                            <p>Global demand is increasing for dietary fish protein, which has resulted in widespread overfishing in wild fisheries, resulting in significant decrease in fish stocks and even complete depletion in some regions. Fish farming allows establishment of artificial fish colonies that are provided with sufficient feeding, protection from natural predators and competitive threats, access to veterinarian service, and easier harvesting when needed, while being separate from and thus do not usually impact the sustainable yields of wild fish populations. While fish farming is practised worldwide, China alone provides 62% of the world's farmed fish production.[2] As of 2016, more than 50% of seafood was produced by aquaculture.[3] In the last three decades, aquaculture has been the main driver of the increase in fisheries and aquaculture production, with an average growth of 5.3 percent per year in the period 2000â€“2018, reaching a record 82.1 million tonnes in 2018.</p>

                                The three main causes of disease are, improper feeding, stress through extreme or toxic condition and attack by disease organisms.
                            </blockquote>
                            <h4>Preventing diseases through good management</h4>
                            <p><br><br>Ensure good water quality: sufficient supply, with adequate dissolved oxygen concentration and free of pollution.<br><br> Keep the pond environment healthy: control silt keep a healthy balance of phytoplankton and zooplankton and exchange water if needed. If necessary, use mechanical aeration Disinfect the pond regularly <br><br>Keep the fish in good condition:control stocking density. Keep different sizes or sexes separate if necessary to control fighting. Ensure good food supply Handle the fish properly, especially during harvesting and sorting/grading Care for your fish during storage and transport. <br><br>Prevent the entry of disease organisms from outside your farm: control wild fish by using filters and screens and regularly eradicate them from canals and ponds disinfect all fish stocks imported from outside as eggs, juveniles or adults
                            <br><br>
                            <h4>Common chemicals and their use on the fish farm</h4>
                            
                            Most chemicals used for controlling disease organisms are toxic and/or irritant for the skin and respiratory tract. Many chemicals can cause serious health problems if swallowed or absorbed through the skin. You should therefore handle chemicals with care, mark them clearly and store them safely, away from children in particular.<br><br> When handling chemicals take at least the following precautions, protect your hands by wearing rubber gloves; if possible wear overalls and boots for general protection, work in a well-ventilated area, handle chemicals carefully, avoiding splashing or spillage and, if accidentally splashed, wash off immediately, clearly mark all containers, equipment and protective clothing used for storing and handling chemicals; unless they can be thoroughly and safely washed out, do not use them for other purposes; store them safely when not in use <br><br>Most chemicals degrade with time. When buying chemicals ensure that they are still of good quality. Check their expiration or "sell by" date, if any. Check also whether they have been stored properly. Clearly indicate on each container the date of purchase. <br><br>For storing chemicals, use a cool, dark, dry and lockable room. Some chemicals may require refrigerator storage; check labels or handling instructions. Generally, chemicals deteriorate more quickly in warm conditions. Keep good records and ensure a good rotation of the stocks.</p>
                            <h4>Buying and storing chemicals</h4><p>Most chemicals degrade with time. When buying chemicals ensure that they are still of good quality. Check their expiration or "sell by" date, if any. Check also whether they have been stored properly. Clearly indicate on each container the date of purchase.<br><br>For storing chemicals, use a cool, dark, dry and lockable room. Some chemicals may require refrigerator storage; check labels or handling instructions. Generally, chemicals deteriorate more quickly in warm conditions. Keep good records and ensure a good rotation of the stocks.</p><h4>Determining the strength of chemicals and their solutions </h4><p>Treatment chemicals are costly and can, in the wrong dosage, be toxic to fish. It is therefore essential to know and understand how the strength of these chemicals is expressed and how dosages can be calculated. You should become familiar with concentrations of chemical solutions, treatment units and their conversion values. You will then be able to avoid wasting chemicals and losing fish.<br><br>Treatment chemicals contain one or more toxic ingredients to disable or kill disease organisms. These are called the active ingredients (AI). The amount of active ingredient contained depends on the chemical. The AI concentration is expressed in percent of the total weight or volume of the chemical;Example, common salt contains 100 percent active ingredient, chlorine bleach powder contains 33 percent Al (chlorine); Wescodyne contains 1.6 percent AI (iodine);Roccal contains from 10 to 50 percent Al (benzalkonium chlorides).<br><br>The usual practice is to dilute solid or liquid chemicals in water and prepare:<ul><li> stock solution, which can be kept for some time, and be diluted as required to a working solution or a treatment dosage (also used when you need to dose very small amounts of chemical);<li>working solution, which is used directly once prepared</li><li>treatment dosage, which is the concentration to which fish are exposed for treatment.</li></ul><br>These solutions are prepared to a recommended strength or concentration, expressed either as: the concentration of the chemical required (e.g. diluted in water, or mixed with feed); or the concentration of active ingredient required.</p>
                            <h4>Identifying the cause of disease</h4>
                            <p> It is not easy to identify in a fish pond why fish show signs of bad health. There are two common situations which you should readily recognize.
                            <ul><li> A large part (if not all) of the fish stock show distress or die suddenly, with only some of the above symptoms of disease such as gasping at the surface or gaping mouths: the cause is prior stress (for example rough or poor handling or transport) and/or bad water quality(often low dissolved oxygen) or the presence of a toxic material such as pesticides or other pollution. You have learned earlier what the signs and possible causes are for low oxygen</li><li> Only a few fish are dead while some others show distress. Usually a few fish die over a period of several weeks and some of the above symptoms are present. The cause is improper feeding and/or development of some disease organism. Examine the fish closely, observing their swimming behaviour and response to feeding. Net a few suspect fish out of the pond and look for visible physical signs of disease, using if possible a magnifying glass. Take samples from skin and gills to be examined under a microscope, either at the farm or in an easily accessible veterinary/medical laboratory</li></ul>If in doubt, do not hesitate to call on specialized assistance, for example from a veterinary extension service. Make a careful record of all the circumstances, to provide as much information as possible to assist specialist diagnosis</p>
                            <h4>Which living organisms cause diseases in fish</h4>
                            <p>There are three major groups of living organisms that may be responsible for fish diseases
                            <ul><li>viruses</li><li>bacteria</li><li>parasites</li></ul><br><br>Viruses are practically invisible organisms. Their detection and identification requires highly specialized laboratory techniques. Control of viral diseases is difficult and requires specialized advice<br><br>Bacteria are minute single-cell organisms, usually living in colonies. Their detection and identification generally also require special laboratory techniques. The treatment of bacterial diseases such as tail or fin rot and skin ulcers requires experienced, specialized advice</p><h4>Using chemicals to treat your fish</h4>
                            <p>Once you have accurately identified the agent, you should decide whether or not to treat the fish with chemicals. Ask yourself the following questions before making a final decision.
                            <ul><li>Is a chemical treatment warranted? Are the fish seriously at risk from the parasite, and are there alternate approaches such as improving environmental conditions and removing seriously affected fish?</li>
                            <li>Is it economically feasible, given the cost of the chemical, the value of the fish and the risks involved?</li>
                            <li>Are the fish still strong enough to survive treatment?</li>
                            <li>s treatment possible in the presence of complicating factors such as an algal bloom, extreme water temperature, low dissolved oxygen or, for example, cloud cover which reduces oxygen production through photosynthesis in the pond </li>
                             <li>Will the chemicals affect any other pond?</li></ul>
                            </p>
